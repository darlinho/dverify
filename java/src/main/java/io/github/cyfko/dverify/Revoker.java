/**
 * Defines the contract for revoking previously issued tokens or credentials.

 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface are responsible for invalidating or blacklisting
 * a token identified by the given {@code target}. The {@code target} can be either:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a globally unique identifier used to track the token (e.g., a long or UUID)</li>
 *   <li>the token itself (e.g., a signed {@code String})</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Future implementations may support additional {@code target} types.
 * This interface is especially useful in distributed systems where token invalidation
 * must be decoupled from token creation and verified at runtime.
